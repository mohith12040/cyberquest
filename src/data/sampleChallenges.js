# üõ°Ô∏è What is Phishing?
Phishing is a cyberattack where attackers impersonate trustworthy organizations via email, SMS, or phone to steal sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or personal identities.

---

## üîç Why Is Phishing Effective?
Phishing attacks often use **psychological manipulation**:
- Fear: "Your account will be suspended!"
- Urgency: "Click now to avoid penalty"
- Curiosity: "Your package is delayed"
- Authority: "This is your bank speaking"

---

## üìÇ Common Phishing Methods

### 1. **Email Phishing**
Bulk emails that appear to come from legitimate sources asking users to click malicious links or download infected attachments.

### 2. **Spear Phishing**
Targeted emails sent to specific individuals, often using personal information to appear credible.

### 3. **Whaling**
Aimed at high-ranking executives. Messages often mimic legal requests or financial actions.

### 4. **Smishing & Vishing**
- Smishing: SMS phishing
- Vishing: Voice phishing (e.g., fake tech support)

---

## üß™ Real-World Case
**Twitter Breach (2020)**:
Hackers used phone spear phishing to trick employees into sharing internal tools. Result: Verified accounts were used to promote cryptocurrency scams.

---

## üîç How to Detect Phishing
- ‚úÖ Check email domain (e.g., "support@micros0ft.com")
- ‚úÖ Hover over links before clicking
- ‚úÖ Avoid emails with urgent requests
- ‚úÖ Watch for poor grammar or generic greetings
- ‚úÖ Confirm with sender via official channels

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Strategies
- üß† User education & phishing simulations
- üîê Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- üß∞ Use email filtering tools (e.g., Microsoft Defender, Proofpoint)
- üóÇ Report phishing attempts to IT/security team
- üß™ Use VirusTotal to scan links/files

---

## üß∞ Tools You Can Use
- **VirusTotal** ‚Äì Scan URLs & files
- **Canarytokens.org** ‚Äì Set traps for attackers
- **PhishTank** ‚Äì Check URLs against a known database
- **MxToolbox** ‚Äì Analyze email headers
- **Have I Been Pwned** ‚Äì Check for exposed credentials

---

## üèÅ Summary
Phishing is more about **manipulating human behavior** than technical flaws. Learn to read between the lines, verify every suspicious communication, and educate others.

## üåê Networking Basics

Computer networking is the practice of connecting computers and devices to share data, resources, and communication services. It forms the foundation of the internet and organizational intranets.

---

### üìò OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)
The OSI model standardizes communication into **7 layers**:

1. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**
   - Closest to the user
   - Interfaces with applications
   - Protocols: HTTP, SMTP, FTP

2. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**
   - Data translation, encryption, compression
   - Examples: TLS/SSL, JPEG, MPEG

3. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**
   - Establishes, manages and terminates connections
   - Example: NetBIOS, RPC

4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**
   - End-to-end communication
   - Ensures reliable delivery (TCP) or fast, unreliable (UDP)

5. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**
   - Routing and logical addressing (IP addresses)
   - Protocols: IP, ICMP

6. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**
   - MAC addresses, switches, error detection
   - Protocols: Ethernet, PPP

7. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**
   - Actual hardware transmission (cables, NICs)

---

### üìó TCP/IP Model
Used practically in the real world; has **4 layers**:

1. **Application Layer**
   - Includes OSI's Application, Presentation, and Session layers
   - Protocols: HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP

2. **Transport Layer**
   - Same as OSI
   - TCP (reliable), UDP (fast)

3. **Internet Layer**
   - Handles IP addressing and routing
   - Protocols: IP, ICMP, ARP

4. **Network Access Layer**
   - Includes OSI's Data Link and Physical layers
   - Deals with MAC, switches, physical media

---

### üîç Why These Models Matter
- **Troubleshooting**: Helps isolate network issues (e.g., Layer 3 = routing issue)
- **Design**: Guides protocol development and network architecture
- **Education**: Builds foundational understanding for advanced topics

---

### ‚úÖ Key Concepts
- **IP Address**: Unique ID for devices (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- **MAC Address**: Physical hardware address (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E)
- **Subnetting**: Dividing networks for efficiency/security
- **Ports**: Identify services (e.g., port 80 = HTTP)
- **DNS**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses
- **Firewall**: Filters traffic for security
- **Router vs. Switch**: Router connects networks; switch connects devices within a network

---

Understanding the OSI and TCP/IP models helps you grasp how digital communication occurs and where things might go wrong.
