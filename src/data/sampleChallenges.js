# üõ°Ô∏è What is Phishing?
Phishing is a cyberattack where attackers impersonate trustworthy organizations via email, SMS, or phone to steal sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or personal identities.

---

## üîç Why Is Phishing Effective?
Phishing attacks often use **psychological manipulation**:
- Fear: "Your account will be suspended!"
- Urgency: "Click now to avoid penalty"
- Curiosity: "Your package is delayed"
- Authority: "This is your bank speaking"

## üìÇ Common Phishing Methods

### 1. **Email Phishing**
Bulk emails that appear to come from legitimate sources asking users to click malicious links or download infected attachments.

### 2. **Spear Phishing**
Targeted emails sent to specific individuals, often using personal information to appear credible.

### 3. **Whaling**
Aimed at high-ranking executives. Messages often mimic legal requests or financial actions.

### 4. **Smishing & Vishing**
- Smishing: SMS phishing
- Vishing: Voice phishing (e.g., fake tech support)
